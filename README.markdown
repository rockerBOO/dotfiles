# Dotfiles

My setup. This is always my most up-to-date configuration for:

* vim
* zsh
* git

...and a few other things.

## Install


To install:

    $ git clone git://github.com/rockerBOO/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    $ ~/.dotfiles/scripts/install.sh

The installer will **never** delete a file from your $HOME directory. If it encounters a file that isn't a symlink, it lets you handle the situation.

## Uninstall

To uninstall:

    $ ~/.dotfiles/scripts/uninstall.sh

This will only remove files of interest from $HOME that are symlinks.
